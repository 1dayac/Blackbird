IT'S ALL NOT TRUE. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TEST THIS TOOL THEN ASK ALEX.
TO BE REWRITTEN (MORELESS EVERYTHING)
The simplest using :
. cpfiles.sh <dataset>
where dataset -- is the specified dataset(QUAKE_CROPPED_400K,...) 
Script copies prd files from the Latest launch of the specified dataset.
To generate data files simply run :
. run.sh            ###DEPRECATED
To generate false positive/negative statistics simply run:
. genFalse.sh
This command manages only those pairs of edges, which have such problems as false negarive/positive at them.
Script creates data/out/* folder structure, where folders "id1_id2_len1_len2" are composed.
There are some files about these two edges in this folder. In order to see a desired plot one needs to type in :
gnuplot plot.conf
in the corresponding folder.
To generate a plot about fpr/fnr run :
java PlotFPR [-s]
-s -- if you want to see current false positive/negative.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common using :
java Main -f <filename> -m <lower bound of edges' length> -l <upper bound of edges' length>
You must have next files in your working directory:
*.grp
*.prd
*_cl.prd
*_fnr.prd
*_fpr.prd

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The folder will be created for each edge pair in 'data' folder.
To view the graph for edge pair run 
gnuplot plot.conf
in the corresponding folder.
